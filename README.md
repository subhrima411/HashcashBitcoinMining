						INTRODUCTION

The project has five different modules :- 

1) Server: This module uses GenServer and contains all the functions needed to run the program on the server side. The server module calls the main GenServer in Elixir which is helpful in passing messages and helps in maintaining the state as well. In this case the initial state is the number of leading zeroes (k) which is entered the first time. The GenServer is initialized with this value.  

2) Worker: This module contains all the functions needed to mine bitcoins on the worker side. 

3) MainServer: This module contains the main function, parses the argument and decides the flow of execution, depending on the argument. This module also contains the findIP() function which discovers the IP address of the server that this program is running on.

4) Hashing: This module contains the bitcoinHashing function which is responsible for actually generating the bitcoins. The 'HashCash algorithm' is used by appending a counter at the end of the randomized string starting from zero. This counter is incremented if the SHA256 hash obtained does not have the 'k' number of leading zeroes. This is carried out in an infinite loop. 

5) RandomizeString: This module contains the functionality to generate random strings. The character set to randomize strings is a-z, A-Z and 0-9. The server directly calls the randomize() function of this module to generate the random string. The worker receives the random string from the server.

						REQUIREMENTS

The following need to be installed to run the project:

Elixir 1.5.1
Virtual Studio Code 1.16.0

				INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

First I create a new mix project by running the command 'mix new project1' on the terminal. This creates a new mix project with the respective lib and config folders along with the mix.exs file. Here, I need to make the following changes to the mix.exs file- I add escript: [main_module: MainServer]] in the definition of project in the mix file so that the main module can be loaded successfully. In the project, the main module is MainServer. 
After saving the mix.exs file, I can run the project by ./project1 [args]
In this case, if the [args] is a number (e.g k = 3), then the Server is mining bitcoins with that many leading zeroes (3 in this case). If the [args] is an IP address, then it is the worker which is asking to participate in the bitcoin mining process. The first call message to the Server returns the value of k to the worker. The second call to the server sends an appended randomized string to the worker, generated by the server. The worker mines bitcoins with these randomized strings and sends it to the server using the 'cast' function if the leading number of zeroes matches the value of k. This is carried out in a loop and every time the worker calls the server to obtain a randomized string.

					PROGRAM FLOW

First the server runs by mining the bitcoins which match the same number of leading zeroes as 'k'. Bitcoins are mined by performing a SHA-256 of a random string which has been appended to my UFID and this process should run infinitely. I can also call the process asynchronously on the server by spawning several processes in the server. 
When the bitcoin mining process is running on the main server, the workers can extend and help the server to mine the bitcoins. In this project the Server provides the initial 'k' value, which is the number of leading zeroes in the bitcoin. It also sends a randomized string to the worker every time it calls the server. The worker and server both mine bitcoins by spawning several processes. I have 10,000 processes right now for both the worker and server in the program. In this project bitcoins are mined by using the 'HashCash Algorithm'. A counter is appended to the randomized string and the resulting string is hashed. If the hash has 'k' leading zeroes, then this is a valid bitcoin. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by one. This counter is initialized to 0 and it keeps getting incremented every time until a bitcoin with 'k' leading zeroes is mined. If the server mines this bitcoin, then it gets printed directly. If a worker mines this bitcoin, then it is sent to the GenServer, who then proceeds to print it on the server. If the server dies and the program terminates on the server, the worker keeps calling the server unknowingly. I have handled this exception by exiting gracefully. The worker gets a message which says 'Server has died' and thus terminates.

					PROJECT QUESTIONS 

1. Size of the work unit that you determined results in best performance for your implementation and an explanation on how you determined it. Size of the work unit refers to the number of sub-problems that a worker gets in a single request from the boss.

In this project, the GenServer is started when the server starts mining bitcoins. Then, the workers can connect to the Server's IP and help in mining the coins and send them to the GenServer. The server provides the appended value (UFID which has to be attached) and also generated a Random string for the client of length 10. In the random string, I have a-z, A-Z and 0-9 as characters.  As I have 62 distinct characters, the total number of possibilities is 62^10 ≃ 8.4×1017. As I'm sampling uniformly from this set, and I have 10^6 unique values already, the probability of a collision is 10^6/62^10 ≃ 1.2×10^−12. The possibility of a collision is about one in a trillion. Also, after creating a random string from the server, I use the hashcash algorithm as a proof of work in bitcoin mining. So, the worker or the server won't be mining the same bitcoins.

The project was run with 1000, 10000 and 100000 work units. I observed that 10000 work units provided the best performance. This program works with First come first serve (FCFS) of the workers. When the workers are running simultaneously with the server, the worker which gets the bitcoin first reports it to the server but this program works in such a way that the workers get connected to the server in the manner of FCFS. The workers get the value of k and the random string of length 10 from the boss in this project. 

2. The result of running your program for ./project1 4

In this project, soumyasen:kjsdfk [which is the UFL id and a random string] is appended to the randomized string generated by the server of length 10. In the first output the random string is sgm5dLEf3M and then using the hashcash algorithm I have discovered the bitcoin with 4 leading zeroes. In the first output the counter at which I get the first hash with 4 leading zeroes is 1012. After separating it with a tab, the SHA-256 of the string with 4 leading zeroes is printed, which is the mined bitcoin. As I are spawning the process infinitely, the program doesn't end till I explicitly terminate it. So, I am providing some of the outputs printed on the console when I run ./project1 4.

3. The running time for the above as reported by time for the above, i.e. run time ./project1 5 and report the time. The ratio of CPU time to REAL TIME tells you how many cores were effectively used in the computation. If your are close to 1 you have almost no parallelism (points will be subtracted).
time ./project1 5

From this figure, I see that in Mac the activity Monitor shows the beam.smp is utilizing 376.4% of the CPU and the CPU usage is using all the 4 cores.

CPU time : - (User time + Sys time)/(Real time) = 425.03/114.744 = 3.704 

I ran this program on MAC OS and then ran the command top and also checked the activity monitor to see the CPU utilization. I see that the top command and the Activity monitor showed the CPU utilization in the range of 350-380. The average CPU utilization was around 360 according to the activity monitor on a quad-core machine. 

4. The coin with the most 0s you managed to find.

This was the number of coins I got after running the project with 7 leading zeroes. I got a bitcoin with 8 leading zeroes as well. 



./project1 8

The maximum number of leading zeroes that I found in a bitcoin was 8. This was found when I connected one worker with the main server.

5. The largest number of working machines you were able to run your code with.

I tried running the project with 4 working machines to mine the bitcoins on the server. Due to the lack of resource, I ran the code with just 4 working machines. One was the main server and the other three machines were the worker machines asking for work from the main server.
